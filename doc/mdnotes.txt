INTRODUCTION           	                                  *mdnotes-intro*

Markdown Notes (mdnotes or Mdn) is a plugin that aims to improve the Neovim
Markdown note-taking experience by providing features like better Wikilink
support, adding/removing hyperlinks to images/files/URLs, file history, asset
management, referencing, backlinks, and formatting. All this without relying
on any LSP but using one is recommended.

==============================================================================
QUICK START            	                             	*mdnotes-quickstart*

To setup `mdnotes` using the Lazy package manager, put this in your `init.lua` file,
>lua
    {
	"ymich9963/mdnotes.nvim",
    }

optionally specifying all the path and file options will allow you to use all
the commnds,
>lua
    {
	"ymich9963/mdnotes.nvim",
	opts = {
	    assets_path = "assets",
	    index_file = "MAIN.md",
	    journal_file = "JOURNAL.md",
	}
    }

Install and then setup using,
>lua
    require('mdnotes.config').setup({
	    assets_path = "assets",
	    index_file = "MAIN.md",
	    journal_file = "JOURNAL.md",
	})

Explanation for the options is given in the next |mdnotes-config| section.

==============================================================================
CONFIG             	                     	      	*mdnotes-config*

The default config for `mdnotes` is shown below,
>lua
    {
	index_file = "",
	journal_file = "",
	assets_path = "",
	insert_file_behaviour = "copy",
	overwrite_behaviour = "error",
	open_behaviour = "buffer",
    }
<
index_file = `"path"`					*mdnotes-index_file*

    Can be any path to your index file which is then accessed by |:Mdn-home|.

journal_file = `"path"`					*mdnotes-journal_file*

    Can be any path to your journal file which is then accessed by |:Mdn journal|.

assets_path = `"path"`					*mdnotes-assets_path*

    Can be any path to your assets folder. This is where any asset you insert
    by using |:Mdn insert_image| or |:Mdn insert_file| is copied or moved to.

insert_file_behaviour = `"string"`		*mdnotes-insert_file_behaviour*

    Can take the values of `"copy"` or `"move"` which copies or moves inserted
    assets respectively.

overwrite_behaviour = `"string"`		*mdnotes-overwrite_behaviour*

    Can take the values of `"error"` or `"overwrite"` which defines how the plugin 
    should handle existing assets. With `"error"` it throws an error and prevents
    the user from inserting the asset. With `"overwrite"` it will overwrite the
    conflicting file.

open_behaviour = `"string"`			*mdnotes-open_behaviour*

    Can take the values of `"buffer"` or `"tab"` which defines how Wikilinks are
    opened using |:Mdn home|, |:Mdn journal|, and |:Mdn open_wikilink|. With
    `"buffer"` it opens them in the current buffer, whereas with `"tab"` it opens them
    in a new tab.

==============================================================================
COMMANDS                                         	*mdnotes-commands*

The Mdnotes plugin uses subcommands through calling `:Mdn <sub command>`. The
subcommands are listed below.

:Mdn home 	                                       	*:Mdn-home*

    Opens the index file depending on |mdnotes-open_behaviour|

:Mdn journal 	                                      	*:Mdn-journal*

    Opens the journal file depending on |mdnotes-open_behaviour|

:Mdn open 	                                      	*:Mdn-open*

    Opens the asset under the cursor. Uses |vim.ui.open| but due to a bug for
    Winows it's currently using, >lua
	vim.system({"cmd.exe", "/c", "start", link}) 

:Mdn open_wikilink 					*:Mdn-open_wikilink*

    Open the Wikilink (e.g. `[[link]]` or `[[link#section]]`) under the cursor. 

:Mdn hyperlink_toggle 					*:Mdn-hyperlink_toggle*

    Toggle inserting and deleting a hyperlink (e.g. `[text](link)`) from your
    clipboard (the `"+` register).

:Mdn show_backlinks 					*:Mdn-show_backlinks*

    Show the backlinks of the current Wikilink under cursor in a quickfix
    list. If not executed on a Wikilink, it shows the backlinks of the current
    file.

:Mdn outliner_toggle					*:Mdn-outliner_toggle*

    Toggle an outliner mode (similar to programs like Logseq). This command
    essentially creates or deletes certain keymaps to create the outliner mode.

:Mdn insert_image					*:Mdn-insert_image*

    Insert the image in the clipboard under the cursor and depending on
    |mdnotes-insert_file_behaviour| place it in your |mdnotes-assets_path|. (e.g
    `![image](path/to/assets/image.png)`)

:Mdn insert_file					*:Mdn-insert_file*

    Exactly the same as |Mdn-insert_image| but it inserts a hyperlink to the
    file (e.g. `[file](path/to/assets/file.txt)`).

:Mdn go_back						*:Mdn-go_back*

    Go back to the previously visited Markdown buffer.

:Mdn go_forward						*:Mdn-go_forward*

    Go forward to the Markdown buffer you were in before you went back.

:Mdn clear_history					*:Mdn-clear_history*

    Clear the history of visited Markdown buffers.

:Mdn cleanup_unused_assets			*:Mdn-cleanup_unused_assets*

    Cleanup unused assets in your |mdnnote-assets_path|. A |vim.ui.input|
    will be used to prompt for `y/n/a(ll)` deletion actions. Uses
    |vim.fs.rm|.

    Note: Data loss will obviously happen with this command so BE CAREFUL.

:Mdn rename_link_references			*:Mdn-rename_link_references*

    Rename the reference to a `[[link]]` and also the file pointing to that
    link.

:Mdn bold_toggle					*:Mdn-bold_toggle*

    Toggle Markdown `**bold**` syntax. Select a word and execute the command
    or hover over already bold text to remove.

:Mdn italic_toggle					*:Mdn-bold_toggle*

    Toggle Markdown `*italic*` syntax. Select a word and execute the command
    or hover over already bold text to remove.

:Mdn strikethrough_toggle			*:Mdn-strikethrough_toggle*

    Toggle Markdown `~~strikethrough~~` syntax. Select a word and execute the 
    command or hover over already bold text to remove.

:Mdn inline_code_toggle				*:Mdn-inline_code_toggle*

    Toggle Markdown `inline code` (``) syntax. Select a word and execute the command
    or hover over already bold text to remove.
==============================================================================
